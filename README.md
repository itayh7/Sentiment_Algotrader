# Sentiment and MACD Algotrader
This project leverages sentiment analysis from social media platforms, news articles, financial reports, and the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator to make stock trading decisions.

To make sense of all this data, we use an XGBoost model, which would helps us predict which stocks are likely to do well.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
